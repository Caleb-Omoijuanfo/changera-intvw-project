# Getting Started.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run locally, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You also need to run the proxy server to get dynamic data. Here's the link. [https://github.com/Caleb-Omoijuanfo/proxy-server-changera](proxy-server).

Once you have successfully cloned the project, you can run:

### `npm install`

and then

### `node index.js`

to start the server. 

Once both projects are running, you can head over to the browser to use the application.
